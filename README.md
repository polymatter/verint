# Verint Data Table
## Requirements

1. Create a semantic table component, with requirements listed below (tip: Create React App
is great for bootstrapping applications)
a. core requirements
i. displays columns and data in a tabular format
ii. clicking the button triggers an event to toggle visibility of the table
iii. custom CSS to make it look presentable
iv. clean, commented code
b. bonus requirements
i. emphasis on modern code (tip: try to find uses for react hooks, or better yet
a custom hook)
ii. add one extra thing of your choice (e.g. extra functionality and/or flair)
2. Make sure the readme documents what you did, and how you did it (along with any build
instructions)
3. Provide us with the code for review (eg. a link to GitHub or zipped up project)

## Approach

- Created a simple DataTable component that displays some tabular data. I guess "semantic" means by using semantic tags like <thead> and the like rather than just doing everything with <div>'s
- I used Create React App as suggested. So `npm start` starts a development server on http://localhost:3000 an `npm run build` builds the production code for deployment
- Since there was no suggestion of what data to use I just found an approriate dataset to demonstrate.
- Used simple logic in the App to display a button that can show or hide the table.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
